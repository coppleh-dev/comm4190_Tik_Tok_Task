    "The Cancelled podcast, hosted by Tana Mongeau and Brooke Schofield, grew quickly after launching in 2021. It was built on chaotic storytelling about influencer culture and their personal lives, which made their best friend dynamic central to the appeal. Over time, fans started noticing tension between the hosts, especially during the live tour where their chemistry seemed less natural. The dynamic shifted again when Brooke’s old tweets resurfaced, including posts that were widely criticized as racist. Tana called the tweets awful, Brooke apologized, and she took a brief break from filming. Although they returned to recording afterward, the energy of the show felt different for many listeners who followed the drama online.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mid-2025 the hosts announced that the podcast would end its regular weekly run. They cited mental health struggles, burnout from the constant sharing of personal stories, and a contract that both described as draining. Tana said she was waiting for the contract to end so she could feel at peace, and Brooke emphasized the emotional toll of performing for the audience each week. They left open the possibility of returning in a different format someday, but the original version of Cancelled ended with episode 130. The friendship between the two remains public but noticeably less close, and fans continue to speculate about what happened behind the scenes.\n",

    "At first, we prompted the LLM with limited information on the cancelled podcast and background of Tana and Brooke, as well as background on the structure of the podcast and who created what. The LLM, without this context, often rated more neutrally than us because there was a lack of context. To prompt the LLM, we offered specific examples of what a comment that favored Tana was and what a comment that favored Brooke was and we uploaded to the LLM along with the context of the siutation. By using the 5 techniques for prompting such as examples and precise, instructions we were able to fine tune the LLM to recognize the different"
